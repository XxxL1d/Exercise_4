    "    4.6. Display that now it's the opponent's turn. \n",
    "    4.7. Make sure there are cards available in opponent's deck. If there aren't, then the game ends and the player wins.\n",
    "    4.8. If there are still cards available in opponent's deck, draw a random card from the opponent's deck, and display its details to the player.\n",
    "    4.9. Then display the cards available in the player's deck. \n",
    "    4.10 Ask the user to pick one card from their own deck to fight the opponent's card. \n",
    "    4.11. REPEAT THE SAME LOGIC AS STATED FROM POINT 4.4 TO 4.5.3. But this time, from the perspective of the opponent.\n",
